# iTunesMusicApp

My own application created in the likeness of iTunes.

Link to API - [iTunes API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/)

##### The application has two screens connected to each other:
1) Library media screen - responsible for the library of selected tracks.
2) Search screen - processing searches for specific tracks in iTunes.

From each screen you can switch to a player that can rewind, change, and pause tracks as well as adjust the sound volume.

You can also minimize the player and while listening to music look for the track you need.


###### Media library screen:
- Play button for the first track 
- Button to sort the playlist by date and alphabet

###### Search screen:
- Has a search tool
- Button for adding a track to favorites

***
#### In general, this is simple and convenient app designed in accordance with'Human Interface Guidelines' by Apple and iTunes style in particular:)
